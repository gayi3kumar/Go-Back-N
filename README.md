# Go-Back-N





Implementing a Reliable Web Service using Go Back N (GBN) Protocol over the UDP transport service.
Reliable Web client and server programs based on the (GBN) Protocol that will communicate on your local machine. 
Gremlin function that will simulate unreliable networks which will corrupt, lose and delay packets.
Important functions in computer networks: 
(1) implementation of segmentation and re-assembly of long messages, 
(2) detecting errors in the received packets, 
(3) guaranteeing reliable data transfer by recovering from failures, such as packet corruption, loss or delays, and 
(4) emulation of packet errors generation and detection.
